      Once upon a time dinosaurs roamed the earth.  They walked around and did normal dinosaur stuff until one day 66 million years ago an astroid crashed into the Yucatan Peninsula and obliterated the vast majority of terrestrial life on Earth.  Mammals rose to fill the void, and they too walked around and did  normal mammal stuff for a few more million years, which consisted mostly of digging around in the dirt and eating bugs.  Eventually they invented the airplane.
