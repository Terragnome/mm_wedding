      Once upon a time dinosaurs roamed the earth.  They walked around and did normal dinosaur stuff until one day 66 million years ago an astroid crashed into the Yucatan Peninsula and annihilated the vast majority of terrestrial life on Earth.  Mammals rose to fill the void, and they too walked around and did  normal mammal stuff for a few more million years, which consisted mostly of digging around in the dirt and eating bugs.  Eventually they invented the airplane.

      Nothing of much consequence happened after that until June 6, 2002 when Melanie and Michael met, dated, and fell in love.  So mass extinctions can cause good things too.  It just takes time.
